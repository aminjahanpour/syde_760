"""
Given the objective function maximize: f(x)=âˆ‘(t=1:3){2u_t+s_t}
subject to usual conservation constraints for all time periods t=1, 2, and 3.

Means of inflows in three periods are 6, 9, and 7 units and

storage is bounded between 0 and 6.

Assume inflows as i.i.d as normal with coefficient of variations of 0.5 or 1.

Calculate a frontier of means and std. deviations for the two cases from optimization

    and compare it with

        results from Monte-Carlo simulation.

Discuss and infer especially regarding the method.

Your method is simulation-optimization and the minimum number of scenarios expected is 1000.
